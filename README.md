University of Oregon Spring 2018 Image Manipulation


File 3H contains all the final code and tests. 3H -> 3H -> ./run_all will run my code with 85 tests and display how many passed. ./clean will remove "pass" from all the files so it can be tested again. My code lives in the sandbox directory: filter.C filter.h image.C image.h logging.C logging.h sink.C sink.h source.C source.h PNMreader.C PNMreader.h PNMwriter.C PNMwriter.h
